# Joy-Duino

In this repo, I/O management techniques of - "Polling" & "Interrupt" are demonstrated.

Further, the "Interrupt" concept is demonstrated using both the Arduino Library (which adds a set of C/C++ functions - providing a degree of abstraction to some low-level concepts), as well as standard C AVR programming.
