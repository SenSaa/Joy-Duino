# Joy-Duino
Joystick input controlling LED output {Arduino}

In this repo, I/O management techniques of - "Polling" & "Interrupt" are demonstrated.

Further, the "Interrupt" concept is demonstrated using both the Arduino Libraries (which adds a set of C/C++ functions - providing a degree of abstraction to some low-lvel concepts), as well as standard C AVR programming.
